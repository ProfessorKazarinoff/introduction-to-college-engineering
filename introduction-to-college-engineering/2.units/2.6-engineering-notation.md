## Engineering Notation

Besides scientific notation, there is another type of notation that is useful for engineers called _engineering notation_.

Engineering notation follows the following format:

 * Like scientific notation is of the form $m \times 10^{n}$
 * In engineering notation, the exponent $n$ is restricted to multiples of 3 (e.g. ...-9, -6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9...)
 * The significand $m$ is restricted such that $1 \leq m < 1000$
 * Engineering notation allows for use of the SI Prefixes when working with SI units

### Examples

Below are a few examples of engineering notation.

---

$6.022 \times 10^{23}$  watts 

$602.2 \times 10^{21}$ watts 

$602.2$ zetta-watts  = $602.2$ ZW

---

$2.040 \times 10^4$ meters 

$20.40 \times 10^3$ meters

$20.40$ kilometers = $20.40$ km

---

$9.000 \times 10^{−6}$ grams 

$9.000 \times 10^{−6}$ grams (stays the same as 6 is already a multiple of 3)

$9.000$ micrograms = $9.000 \ \mu g$
