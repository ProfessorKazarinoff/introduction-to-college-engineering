## Significant Figures

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 * Explain the purpose of significiant figures to engineers and scientists.
 * Determine the correct number of significant figures present in a measured or calculated value.
 * Determine the correct number of significant figures for the result of a computation.

### Why Significant Figures

 > Why should engineers learn about and use significant figures?

An important factor in any measurement is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, a standard ruler can measure length to the nearest millimeter whereas calipers can measure length to the nearest 0.01 mm. A caliper is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in length. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise the measurements.

When we express measured values, we can only list as many digits (called significant figures) as we measured initially with our measuring tool. For example, if we use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, we may measure it to be 36.7 cm. We can’t express this value as 36.71 cm because our measuring tool is not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter.

It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36.6 cm and 36.7 cm, and they must estimate the value of the last digit. 

```{note}
Significant figures are one way that engineers and scientists communicate the precision of a measured or calculated value.

2.3 cm and 2.30000 cm are equal values. However, 2.3 cm demonstates a value with greater precision than writing 2.3 cm.
```

Using a method of _significant figures_, the rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. To determine the number of significant digits in a value, start with the first measured value at the left and count the number of digits through the last digit written on the right. For example, the measured value 36.7 cm has three digits, or three significant figures.

```{tip}
Significant figures indicate the precision of the measuring tool used to measure a value.

Significant figures indicates the certainty or confidenece in a calculated value.

### Counting Significant Figures

Significant figures are critical because they indicate how accurately you could actually measure/report your measured data or calculated values. Below are the guidelines for counting the number of significant figures displayed in a measured or calculated value.

```{card} **Guidelines for Counting Significant Figures**
1. ALL non-zero digits (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) are significant.

2. ALL zeroes between non-zero digits are significant.

3. ALL zeroes which are SIMULTANEOUSLY to the right of the decimal point AND at the end of the number are significant.

4. ALL zeroes which are to the left of a written decimal point and are in a number >= 10 are significant.

#### Examples of Significant Figures

Below is a chart of example measrured and calculated values and the corresponding number of significant figures represented by each value. Note the abreviation _sig figs_ stands for _significant figures_.

| Value | Number of Significant Figures |
| --- | --- |
| 48,923 people | 5 sig figs |
| 3.967 mm | 4 sig figs |
| 900.06 kg | 5 sig figs |
| 0.0004 mW | 1 sig fig |
| 8.1000 MPa | 5 sig figs |
| 501.040 A | 6 sig figs |
| 10.0 cm | 3 sig figs |
| 130. in/in | 2 sig figs |

### Significant Figures in Calculations

The following specifies the rules for using significant figures in calculations. Remember the purpose of significant figures is to show other engineers and scientists how precisely you certain about a measured or calculated value. Any calculations made with a measured value can not be more precise or be known with more certainty than the measured value.

```{card} **Rules for Significant Figures in Calculations**

**Multiply/Divide:** Count the NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES. The answer cannot CONTAIN MORE SIGNIFICANT FIGURES THAN THE NUMBER BEING MULTIPLIED OR DIVIDED with the LEAST NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT FIGURES.

**Add/Subtract:** Count the NUMBER OF DECIMAL PLACES. The answer cannot CONTAIN MORE PLACES AFTER THE DECIMAL POINT THAN THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF DECIMAL PLACES in the numbers being added or subtracted.

**Exact Numbers:** The numbers π and e are derived from mathematical relationships and are precise to an infinite number of significant figures. Exact unit conversions or exact counted quantities are precise to an infinite number of significant figures.

**Rounding Error:** Be aware of rounding error. Keep +2 more significant figures in all intermediate caclulations. Only round the final calculated value.
```

### Rounding Numbers

After completing a calculation, the final caclualted value needs to be rounded to the appropriate number of significant figures. The number of significant figures or decimal place to round to was specificed in the previous section. In this section, we discuss how to round a numerical value given the number of significant figures or decimal place has already been determined.

```{card} Rounding Numbers
Replace a number having a given number of digits with a number (called the rounded number) having a smaller number of digits, apply the following rules:

**Rule 1.** If the digits to be discarded begin with a digit less than 5, the digit preceding the 5 is not changed.

Example: 6.9749515 rounded to 3 digits is 6.97

**Rule 2.** If the digits to be discarded begin with a 5 and at least one of the following digits is greater than 0,
the digit preceding the 5 is increased by 1.

Examples: 6.9749515 rounded to 2 digits is 7.0

6.9749515 rounded to 5 digits is 6.9750

**Rule 3.** If the digits to be discarded begin with a 5 and all of the following digits are 0, the digit preceding
the 5 is unchanged if it is even and increased by 1 if it is odd. (Note that this means that the final
digit is always even.)

Examples: 6.9749515 rounded to 7 digits is 6.974952

6.9749505 rounded to 7 digits is 6.974950
