## Unit Conversion

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 * Use conversion factors to convert a given quantity into a different set of units.

### Why Unit Conversion is Important

### Unit Conversion Factors

To convert between different units, we need to how how much one unit is equal to in another unit. These are called _conversion factors_. Conversion factors can be used to convert between units in one system, such as 1 m = 100 cm in the SI unit system. Conversion factors can also be used to convert between units accross different unit systems, such as 1 m = 39.3701 in. 

Below is a table of some common conversion factors.

| Table of Conversion Factors |
| --- |
| **Length** |
| 1 m = 3.28084 ft |
| 1 in = 2.54 cm (exact) |
| 1 ft = 12 in |
| 1 mi = 5280 (exact) |
| **Volume** |
| 1 cm<sup>3</sup> = 1 mL (exact) |
| 1 ft<sup>3</sup> = 7.48052 gal |
| 1 gal = 231 in<sup>3</sup> (exactly) |
| **Mass** |
| 1 lb<sub>m</sub> = 0.45359237 kg (exact) |
| 1 slug = 32.174 lb<sub>m</sub> |


### Unit Conversion Process

The unit conversion process uses the fact that any number or expression can be multiplied by 1 without changing its value. This allows the conversion of units by multiplying the initial value by one (or more) forms of the number 1.

```{note}
While the multiplication by 1 _does not change the value of a measurement_, multiplying a value by 1 _can change the measurement units_.
```

It may be necessary to multiply by more than one conversion ratios in complex conversions. Use the steps below to construct a unit conversion problem so one (or more) of the units cancel until only the desired unit remains:

```{card} Unit Conversion Steps
**Step 1.** Identify the unit you have. These are the _Starting Units_ or _Initial Units_.

**Step 2.** Identify the unit you want. These are the _Desired Units_ or _Final Units_.

**Step 3.** Identify appropriate unit conversion factor(s). These are the Linking (or Ratio) Unit(s). Use **EXACT** conversion factors whenever available.

**Step 4.** Cancel units and perform the math calculations (e.g., multiply, divide). Repeat the calculation (double check).

**Step 5.** Evaluate the result. _Does the answer make sense?_

```

Below are some best practices to consider when completing unit conversion calculations.

```{tip} **Unit Conversion Best Practices**

 * Multiply the numerators (across) and denominators (across) to calculate an intermediate answer, then divide. Documenting the calculation steps can be especially helpful when problem-solving errors.

 * Do not round any quantities used within the calculation. Keep at least two more digits of precision in each calculated value than is present in the initial value.

 * Only round the final calculated quantity.
```

Many unit conversion problems will require only a single unit conversion factor. However, multiple factors may be required to solve a problem. These figures illustrate both examples. Remember that Step 3, identifying the conversion factor, is often the most challenging step. If an incorrect (or approximate) conversion factor is used, a correct solution will not be achieved.

**Worked Example**

An engineer has designed a new 5 m computer cable but must represent the length in centimeters within an owner manual diagram. How many cm is the length?
