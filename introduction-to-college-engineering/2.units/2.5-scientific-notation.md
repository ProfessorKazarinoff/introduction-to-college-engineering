## Scientific Notation

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

 * Identify numbers written in scientific notation
 * Convert numbers between scientific notation and standard notation

 ### Definition

 Scientific notation is a specific format used by engineers and scientists to display a number. The rules that define the scientific notation number format are below:

 * Is of the form $m \times 10^{n}$
 * all digits in the significand $m$ are significant
 * The significand $m$ is restricted such that $1 \leq m < 10$
 * $n$ is an integer, positive or negative

### Examples

 * $6.022 \times 10^{23}$  atoms
 * $2.040 \times 10^{4}$  meters
 * $9.000 \times 10^{-6}$  grams

All of the examples above show values writen in scientific notation and contain 4 significiant figures.

Scientific notation is particularly useful when the numbers are very large or very small. For example the number of atoms in a mole is 602200000000000000000000 atoms/mole or the Planck constant $h$ which is 0.000000000000000000000000000000000663 J$\cdot$sec. It is cumbersome to write all the zeros in both of these cases. 

Scientific notation is an alternative, compact representation of these numbers. For scientific notation, the factor  $10^n$ indicates the power of ten to multiply the coefficient by to convert back to decimal form.

This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient fifteen places to the right.

A negative exponent indicates that the number is very small:

This is equivalent to moving the decimal in the coefficient eleven places to the left.

Let's re-write Planck's constant and the number of atoms per mole in scientific notation:

| Standard Notation | Scientific Notation |
| --- | --- |
| 602200000000000000000000 atoms/mole | $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ atoms/mole |
| 0.000000000000000000000000000000000663 J$\cdot$s | $6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J$\cdot$s |

### Summary

Scientific notation is useful when measured or calculated values are very large or very small. Scientific notation is of the form:

$m \times 10^{n}$

where $1 \leq m < 10$ and $n$ is an integer.

Measured or calculated values can be converted from standard notation into scientific notation by converting the location of a decimal point into an exponent. To go from scientific notation to standard notation, convert the exponent into a located decimal point.
