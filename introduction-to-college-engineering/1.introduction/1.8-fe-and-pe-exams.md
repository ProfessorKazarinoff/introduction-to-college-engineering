## The FE and PE Exams

Besides graduating from an ABET-accredited college engineering program, many engineers take to engineering specific exams. The FE Exam stands for the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam. The PE Exam stands for the Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam.

The FE and PE Exams are administered by National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying which is abriviated as NCESS.

### FE

According to NCESS:

The requirements to take the FE Exam are:

 * Enrolled in an ABET-accredited engineering program

Often college engineering students take the FE Exam in their senior or 4th year. The FE Exam is taken on a computer usually at a testing center outside of college or coursework.

### PE

According to the NCESS:

 > The Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) exam tests for a minimum level of competency in a particular engineering discipline. It is designed for engineers who have gained a minimum of four years post-college work experience in their chosen engineering discipline.

The requirements to take the PE Exam are:

 * Pass the FE Exam
 * Graduate from an ABET-accredited engineering program
 * Four years post-college work experience in the engineering discipline the PE Exam corresponds to

Working engineers take the PE Exam after they work under a senior engineer for four or more years.
