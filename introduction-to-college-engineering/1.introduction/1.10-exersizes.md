## Exersizes

1. Given that the state of Oregon has 3 public 4-year universities that grant engineering degrees, create a chart that shows these 3 public universities and the types of degrees each university offers. Use the ABET website (https://www.abet.org/) to create your chart.

2. There are two professional exams that engineers can take to become certified in their profession. One is called the FE, the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam and the other is called the PE or Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam. Use the NCEES website (https://ncees.org/) to compare and contrast these two exams. List at least two things the exams have in common and at least two things that separate them.

3. Pick a particular engineering degree at the particular university that you plan to pursue. For this degree, find the FE and PE exam or exams (there may be more than one) that corresponds to this type of engineering degree. If multiple exams are possible, list them all. Use the NCEES website (https://ncees.org/) and the ABET website (https://www.abet.org/).

4. Engineers who have completed the PE exam are sometimes called Professional Engineers, Stamping Engineers or Senior Engineers. Engineers who have not completed the PE exam, but have graduated from a 4-year college or university engineering program are sometimes considered Associate Engineers or Junior Engineers. What are the advantages and disadvantages for a job candidate who is a Senior Engineer compared to the advantages and disadvantages of a Junior Engineer job candidate? Create a chart and list two advantages and two disadvantages for each job candidate type (Junior Engineer and Senior Engineer).
