#### FE and PE Exam Calculators

The Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE) and the Principles and Practice of Engineering Exam (PE) require certain specific scientific calculator models. Consider one of these approved calculator models to use during your engineering education. As these calculator models will be the kind you will use on the FE and PE exams.

According to NCESS, the organization which administers the FE and PE Exams:

 > To protect the integrity of its exams, NCEES limits the types of calculators examinees may bring to exam sites. The list of approved calculators is reviewed annually.

The following calculator models are the only ones acceptable for use during the 2025 exams:

 * Casio: All fx-115 and fx-991 models (Any Casio calculator must have "fx-115" or "fx-991" in its model name.)
 
 * Hewlett Packard: The HP 33s and HP 35s models, but no others

 * Texas Instruments: All TI-30X and TI-36X models (Any Texas Instruments calculator must have "TI-30X" or "TI-36X" in its model name.)
