## Vector Magnitude

The magnitude of a vector is it's length. Vector magnitudes are always positive or zero.

### 2D Magnitude

The magnitude of a 2D vector is given by

$$ \lvert\vec{A}\rvert = A = \sqrt{A_{x}^2 + A_{y}^2} $$

### 3D Magnitude

The magnitude of a 3D vector is given by

$$ \lvert\vec{A}\rvert = A = \sqrt{A_{x}^2 + A_{y}^2 + A_{z}^2} $$

We still square the components and take the square root of the sum, even though 3D vectors have 3 components.

### Angle of a 2D vector

The angle $\alpha$ of a vector relative +CCW from the +x-axis can be found using the tangent of the components. 

$$ \alpha = \tan^-1\left(\frac{A_y}{A_x}\right) $$
