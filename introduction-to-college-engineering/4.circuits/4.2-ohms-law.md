## Ohm's Law

Ohm’s law states that the potential difference across a conductor is directly proportional to the current.

$$ V \propto I $$

Where $V$ is the potential difference and $I$ is the current.

Introducing a constant of proportionality $R$, denoting resistance, Ohm's law can be writen as:

$$ V = IR $$

### Resistance

Electrical resistance, R,  is an impedance to current flow through a circuit.

By rearranging Ohm’s law, the resistance between any two points of a conductor is determined by applying a potential difference ($V$)  between those two points and measuring the current, $I$, that results.

$$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$

The SI unit for resistance is ohm ($\Omega$)

$$ \Omega = \frac{1V}{1A} $$

It is often necessary to find the equivalent or total resistance of two or more resistors connected together. Two ways to connect resistors together is in _series_ or in _parallel

### Resistors in Series

$$ R_t = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + \ldots + R_n $$

```{card} **Worked Example**
**GIVEN:**

Three resistors are connected in series.

$R_1 = 10 \ \Omega$, $R_2 = 20 \ \Omega$, $R_3 = 30 \ \Omega$

**FIND:**

The total resistance of the three resistors connected together, $R_t$

**SOLUTION:**

$$ R_t = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 $$

$$ R_t = 10 \ \Omega + 20 \ \Omega + 30 \ \Omega $$

$$ R_t = 50 \ \Omega $$

```

### Resistors in Parallel

![resistors in parallel](images/resistors_in_parallel.jpg)

$$ \frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + \ldots + \frac{1}{R_n} $$

```{card} **Worked Example**
**GIVEN:**

Three resistors are connected in parallel.

$R_1 = 10 \ \Omega$, $R_2 = 20 \ \Omega$, $R_3 = 30 \ \Omega$

**FIND:**

The total resistance of the three resistors connected together, $R_t$

**SOLUTION:**

$$ \frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} $$

$$ \frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{1}{10 \ \Omega} + \frac{1}{20 \ \Omega} + \frac{1}{30 \ \Omega} $$

$$ \frac{1}{R_t} = \frac{6}{60 \ \Omega} + \frac{3}{60 \ \Omega} + \frac{2}{60 \ \Omega} = \frac{11}{60 \ \Omega} $$

$$ R_t = \frac{60}{11} \Omega \approx 5.45 \ \Omega $$
