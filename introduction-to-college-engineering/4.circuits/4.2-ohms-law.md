## Ohm's Law

Ohm’s law states that the potential difference across a conductor is directly proportional to the current.

$$ V \propto I $$

Where $V$ is the potential difference and $I$ is the current.

Introducing a constant of proportionality $R$, denoting resistance, Ohm's law can be writen as:

$$ V = IR $$

### Resistance

Electrical resistance, R,  is an impedance to current flow through a circuit.

By rearranging Ohm’s law, the resistance between any two points of a conductor is determined by applying a potential difference ($V$)  between those two points and measuring the current, $I$, that results.

$$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$

The SI unit for resistance is ohm ($\Omega$)

$$ \Omega = \frac{1V}{1A} $$

It is often necessary to find the equivalent or total resistance of two or more resistors connected together. Two ways to connect resistors together is in _series_ or in _parallel. Combinations of resistors will be addressed in the next section.
