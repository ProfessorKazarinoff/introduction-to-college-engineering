## Discrete and Countinous Measurements

There are two types of measurements we are concerned about when applying staticists to engineering problems: _discrete measurements_ and _continous measurements_.

### Discrete Measurements

Discrete measurements can include simple probabilities such as the flip of a coin or the toss of a die.

For example: A six sided die.

 * 6 discrete results 1,2,3,4,5, or 6
 * equal probability of occurrence of 1 in 6

### Countinous Measurements

More complex cases, may have an unlimited number of values.

For example: The probability of a personâ€™s age is not a discrete value. We can cut time into infinitesimally small increments.
