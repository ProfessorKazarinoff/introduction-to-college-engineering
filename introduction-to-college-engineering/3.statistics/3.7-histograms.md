## Histograms

It is often useful to have a graphical representation of the data when using statistics. One of those images is called a _histogram_.

A histogram is a bar graph that displays frequency of occurrence, also called a frequency distribution.

### How to create a Histogram

How to create a histogram for a particular data set of n points.
Determine the smallest and largest values.

1. Find the range of the data.

range = largest value â€“ smallest value

2. Determine classes (bins) for the data.  

 * No fewer than 6 classes should be used.
 * A good rule of thumb for the number of bins is

$$ n_{bins} = \sqrt{n} $$
         
* Classes should be of equal size.
* Bin width = range / number of bins

3. Determine the number of data points in each class.

4. Draw the histogram

 * no spaces between the bars
