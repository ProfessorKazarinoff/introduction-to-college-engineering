## Histograms

 It is often useful to have a graphical representation of the data when using statistics. One of those images is called a _histogram_.

A histogram is a bar graph that displays frequency of occurrence, also called a frequency distribution.

### How to create a Histogram

How to create a histogram for a particular data set of n points:

1. Find the range of the data.

range = largest value â€“ smallest value

2. Determine classes (bins) for the data.  

 * No fewer than 6 classes should be used.
 * A good rule of thumb for the number of bins is:

$$ n_{bins} = \sqrt{n} $$
         
* Classes should be of equal size.
* Bin width = range / number of bins

3. Determine the number of data points in each class. Create a chart with the bin ranges in one column and the number of data points within that bin range in the second column

4. Draw the histogram. Scale your y-axis corresoning to the highest frequency. Spread your bin ranges out across the x-axis. It can be helpful to draw a line for the top of each bin then fill in the vertical bars for each bin. Note: histograms typically have no spaces between the bars.

```{card} **Worked Example**
**GIVEN:** Commute times for a class students to get from their home to an in-person engineering class were recorded to the nearest minute. Individual commute times given below

23, 25, 40, 35, 36, 47, 33, 28, 48, 34, 20,
20, 37, 36, 23, 33, 36, 20, 27, 50, 34, 12,
47, 18, 28, 52, 21, 44, 34, 13, 40, 49, 54

**FIND:** Draw a histogram of the data

1. Find the range

range = max - min = 54 - 12 = 42

2. Create the bins

$$ n_{bins} = \sqrt{33} = 5.7445 $$

Since 5.7455 is less than 6, we will use the minimum number of bins.

$$ n_{bins} = 6 $$

Determine the bin width

$$ bin \ width = \frac{range}{n_{bins}} $$

$$ bin \ width = \frac{42}{6} = 7 $$

Create a chart of bin ranges and the number of data points in each

| bin range |
| --- |
| 12 - 18 |
| 19 - 25 |
| 26 - 32 |
| 33 - 39 |
| 40 - 46 |
| 47 - 54 |

3. Determine the number of data point
