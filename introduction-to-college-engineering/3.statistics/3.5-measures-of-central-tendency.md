## Measures of Central Tendency

A measure of central tendency is a single number that describes the center of a particular data set.

There are three measures of central tendency: _mean_, _median_, and _mode_. 

### Mean

#### Mean of a Population

For a population of size _N_, the mean Âµ is written as:

#### Mean of a Sample

For a sample of size _n_, the mean $\bar{x}$ is written as:

### Median

The median is the value in the center of a data set when the set is arranged in ascending or descending order.  

If there are an even number of data points, it is the midpoint of the two central points.

### Mode

The mode is one or more sets of numbers that occur with the greatest frequency in a data set.

Not all data sets will have a mode.

 * If it has a single mode it is uni-modal.
 * If it has 2 it is bimodal.
 * If it has 3 it is trimodal.
 * If all values occur the same number of times, there is no mode.
