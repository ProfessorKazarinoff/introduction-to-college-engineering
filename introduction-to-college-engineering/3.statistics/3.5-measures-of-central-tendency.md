## Measures of Central Tendency

A measure of central tendency is a single number that describes the center of a particular data set.

Three measures of central tendency are: _mean_, _median_, and _mode_. 

### Mean

#### Mean of a Population

For a population of size _N_, the mean µ is written as:

$$ \mu = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N $$

`````{admonition} Tip

The Greek letter μ (pronounced "mew") represents the mean of a population.

#### Mean of a Sample

For a sample of size _n_, the mean $\bar{x}$ is written as:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n $$

```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip
The letter used to represent the mean of a sample is an x with a bar over it (pronounced “x bar”):  $\bar{x}$

One of the requirements for the mean of a sample ($\bar{x}$) to be a good estimate of the mean of the population (μ) it is sampled from is for the sample taken to be truly random.

```{card} Worked Example
**GIVEN:**

A data set considered a sample contains the values:

1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4

**FIND:**

The mean of the sample, $\bar{x}$.

**SOLUTION:**

Count the number of values in the data set:

$$ n = 11 $$

Calculate the mean of the sample:

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n $$

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{1+1+1+2+2+3+4+4+4+4+4}{11} = 2.7 $$

$$ \bar{x} = 2.7 $$

```

### Median

The median is the value in the center of a data set when the set is arranged in ascending or descending order.  

If there are an even number of data points, the median is the midpoint of the two central points.

### Mode

The mode is one or more sets of numbers that occur with the greatest frequency in a data set.

Not all data sets will have a mode.

 * If it has a single mode it is uni-modal.
 * If it has 2 it is bimodal.
 * If it has 3 it is trimodal.
 * If all values occur the same number of times, there is no mode.

```{card} **Worked Example**
**GIVEN:**

A data set contains the numbers below:

15 22 23 24 27 27 28 28 28 29 30 31 33 34 34 35 35 35 35 35 37 40 41 46 47 51 55 56 72 74

**FIND:**

The mean, median and mode for the data set. Assume the data set reprents a sample.

**SOLUTION:**

**MEAN** 

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{15+22+23+23+...+72+74}{30} = \frac{1107}{30} $$

$$ \bar{x} = 36.9 $$

**MEDIAN**

List the values in the data set from smallest to largest. The two central values are 34 and 35.

$$ median = \frac{34+35}{2} = 34.5 $$

**MODE**

Find the value that occurs with the greatest frequency. The value that occurs most often is 35.

$$ mode = 35 $$
