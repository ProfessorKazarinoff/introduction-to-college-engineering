### Measures of Variance

A measure of variation describes the amount of spread or deviation in the data about the mean.

#### Standard Deviation of a Sample

For a sample of size $n$, we use the symbol $\bar{x}$ to describe the mean. For a sample, the equation for standard deviation is given by:

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2} $$

#### Standard Deviation of a Population

The equation for standard deviation for a population of size $N$ is given by:

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2} $$

Note that we can only know Âµ if we have measured an entire population.

### Variance

Another measure of variation is variance, which is simply the square of the standard deviation.

For a sample size $n$:

$$ s^{2} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2 $$

For a population size $N$:

$$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2 $$
