## Samples and Populations

We want to accurately predict the probability of an event.

We use an accurate mathematical model that correlates the attributes of a _sample_ with that of the _population_ it was taken from.

 > What is a sample?  What is a population?

### Population

A population, _N_, is the total number of observable objects.

Such as: 

 * The total number of processors in a production run.
 * The human population of the earth.
 * The number of students enrolled at Portland Community College.

```{tip}
The number of values in a _popluation_ is typically described by the capital letter _**N**_.
```

Populations usually contain a very large numbers of objects.  It would be difficult to evaluate every case so a sample is taken.

### Sample

A sample, _n_, is any subset of the population.

Such as:

 * 1000 processors from a production run of 1 million.
 * The population of the United States is a sample of the population of the earth.
 * The number of students enrolled in a class, are a sample of the population of students enrolled at Portland Ccommunity College.

```{tip}
The number of values in a _sample_ is typically described by the lowercase letter _**n**_.

Capitalization matters when describing the numbers of elements in a sample (_**n**_) or population (_**N**_).
```

Ideally, a sample should be representative of the population, and there are guidelines with relating the characteristics of a sample to that of its population.
