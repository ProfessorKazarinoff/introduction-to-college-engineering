## Samples and Populations

We want to accurately predict the probability of an event.

We use an accurate mathematical model that correlates the attributes of a _sample_ with that of the _population_ it was taken from.

So what is a sample?  What is a population?

### Population

Population, _N_, is the total number of observable objects.

Such as: 

 * The total number of processors in a production run.
 * The human population of the earth.
 * The number of students enrolled at Portland Community College.

Populations are typically very large numbers of objects.  It would be difficult to evaluate every case so a sample is taken.

### Sample

A sample, _n_, is any subset of the Population.

Such as:

 * 1000 processors from a production run of 1 million.
 * The population of the United States is a sample of the population of the earth.
 * The number of students enrolled in this class, are a sample of the students enrolled at PCC.

Ideally a sample should be representative of the population, and there are guidelines with relating the characteristics of a sample to that of itâ€™s population.
