## Measures of Variation

A measure of variation describes the amount of spread or deviation in the data about the mean. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely around the mean. In other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation.

### Standard Deviation

The _standard deviation_ is a number that measures how far values are from the mean of all the values in a data set.

 * Standard deviation provide a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set
 * Standard deviation can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.

The standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when all of the values are concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation.

Standard deviation is calculated slightly differently if the data set represents a _population_ or a _sample_.

#### Standard Deviation of a Sample

For a sample of size $n$, we use the symbol $\bar{x}$ to describe the mean. For a sample, the equation for standard deviation, _s_ is given by:

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2} $$

#### Standard Deviation of a Population

The equation for standard deviation for a population of size $N$ is given by:

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2} $$

Note that we can only know µ if we have measured an entire population.

```{card} **Worked Example**
**GIVEN:**

In an  in-person college engineering class, the communute times to get to the class were recorded to the nearest minute. The following data are for the commute times for a _sample_ n=17 students.

12, 20, 20, 20, 25, 27, 30, 35, 35, 35, 40, 40, 45, 50, 54, 85, 90

**FIND:**

Determine the mean commute time for students in the class and determine the standard deviation of commute times for the class.

**SOLUTION:**

Calculate the mean, $\bar{x}$ :

$$ \bar{x} = \frac{12 + 3(20) + 25 + 27 + 30 + 3(35) + 2(40) + 45 + 54 + 85 + 90}{17} $$

$$ \bar{x} = 39 $$

Calculate the standard deviation, _s_ :

We'll use a table to calculate parts of the standard deviation. Remember the equation for the standard deviation of a sample:

$$ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2} $$

Our table with have columns for the data value, the frequency (or number of times this data occurs), deviation from the mean, diviation from the mean squared and frequency multiplied by deviation from the mean.

| Data | Frequency | Deviation from the mean | (Deviation from the mean)<sup>2</sup> | Frequency*(Deviation from the mean)<sup>2</sup> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| _x_ | _f_ | (x-$\bar{x}$) | (x-$\bar{x}$)<sup>2</sup> | f*(x-$\bar{x}$)<sup>2</sup> |
| 12 | 1 | 1 - 39 = -38 | (-38)<sup>2</sup> = 1444 | 1*1444 = 1444 |
| 12	| 1	| -27	| 729	| 729 |
| 20	| 3	| -19	| 361	| 1083 |
| 25	| 1	| -14	| 196	| 196 |
| 27	| 1	| -12	| 144	| 144 |
| 30	| 1	| -9	| 81	| 81 |
| 35	| 3	| -4	| 16	| 48 |
| 40	| 2	| 1	| 1	| 2 |
| 45	| 1| 	6	| 36	| 36 |
| 50	| 1	| 11	| 121	| 121 |
| 54	| 1	| 15	| 225	| 225 |
| 85	| 1	| 46	| 2116	| 2116 |
| 90	| 1	| 51	| 2601	| 2601 |
| 	| 	| 	| | sum = 7382 |

The sample variance, _s_<sup>2</sup>, is equal to the sum of the last column (7382) divided by the total number of data values minus one (17 – 1):

$$ s^{2} = \frac{7382}{17-1} = 461.375 $$

Then we need to take the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation, _s_:

$$ s = \sqrt{461.375} = 21.4796 $$

$$ s = 21 \ min $$

```

### Variance

Another measure of variation is variance, which is simply the square of the standard deviation.

For a sample size $n$:

$$ s^{2} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \overline{x})^2 $$

For a population size $N$:

$$ \sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2 $$
