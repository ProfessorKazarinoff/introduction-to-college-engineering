## Laws of Motion

If no net force acts on a body, the body's velocity cannot change; that is, the body cannot accelerate.  If the body is at rest, it stays at rest.  If it is moving, it continues to move with constant velocity.

The net force on a body is equal to the product of the body's mass and its acceleration.

$$ F = ma $$

When two bodies interact, the forces on the bodies from each other are always equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

$$ \vec{F_{ab}} = \vec{F_{ba}} $$
