## Exersizes

1. A 250 $lb_m$ box is held in place by a cord with a spring scale on an inclined plane as shown. Assume the surface between the ramp and the box is frictionless.

Determine:

a. The free body diagram for the box

b. The weight of the box in pound-force given that it is on the moon with acceleration due to gravity of
approximately 5.37 $ft/s^2$

c. The force reading on the scale when the ramp is inclined $20^{\circ}$ as shown.

2. A construction worker holds a 200 $kg$ crate in the position shown. The crane is on Earth where the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 $m/s^2$.

Determine:

a. The free body diagram for point A

b. What force must the worker exert on the cable to keep the crate in equilibrium?

3. An object is suspended from cables as shown below. Assume the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 $m/s^2$.

a. Draw the free body diagram for the system; label all forces and angles.

b. What is the tension in AB?

c. What is the tension in AC?

4. Forces A and B act on a point at the origin as shown. It is known that:

$$ A = 45 \ lb_f $$

$$ B = 90 \ lb_f $$

$$ \alpha = 20^{\circ}$$

$$ \beta = 50^{\circ} $$

A third applied Force, C, puts the system in equilibrium.
