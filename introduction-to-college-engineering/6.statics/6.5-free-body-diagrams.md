## Free Body Diagrams

For evaluating force systems it is helpful to create a free body diagram.

A free body diagram includes the coordinate system of reference and all external forces acting on a body.

### How to Draw Free Body Diagrams

1. Identify the body you wish to isolate and make a simple drawing of it. 

2. Draw the appropriate force vectors at all location of supports, connections, and contact with other bodies. 

3. Be sure to include a force vector for the weight of the body, unless gravitational force is to be neglected in the analysis. 

4. Label all forces. 

5. Draw a coordinate system on or near the free-body to establish directions of the forces.
