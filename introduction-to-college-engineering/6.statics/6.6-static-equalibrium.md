## Static Equalibrium

A body is in static or dynamic equilibrium if the sum of all external forces acting on the body is zero. 

∑𝑭 ⃗=0

∑𝑭 ⃗=𝑚𝒂 ⃗

𝒂 ⃗=0

As force is a vector can write equation in component form:

∑𝑭 ⃗=0

∑𝑭 ⃗=∑𝐹_𝑥 𝑖 ̂ + ∑𝐹_𝑦 𝑗 ̂ + ∑𝐹_𝑧 𝑘 ̂

Which can be separated into 3 scalar equations of equalibrium:

∑𝐹_𝑥=0

∑𝐹_𝑦=0

∑𝐹_𝑧=0
