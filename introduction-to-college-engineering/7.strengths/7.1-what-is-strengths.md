## What is Strengths?

In the previous chapter, we discussed the subject of statics. In statics two assumptions are typically made:

 * The free body is in static equalibrium
 * The free body does not deform

However, given a load or force applied to a component, if the component is fixed in place, the load or force could cause the component to bend and even break. 

Mechanics is the study of the state of rest or motion of bodies that are subjected to forces.

External forces act on a body 

For example, the weight of the crate acts on the supporting cable.

If the system is in equilibrium we know that the tension (tensile force) in the cable is equal to the weight of the crate.

What does this do to the cable? The weight of the box will cause the cable to stretch.
